        <h3>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h2>
          <p>#fstoco is organized by a diverse group of individuals, our Executive Director identifies as a homosexual, our board is comprised of people of colour, and our volunteers come from all walks of life. However, we don't stop there! We pay close attention to our speaker lineup to ensure different points of views from different types of people are presented, especially women, we make sure that our event is a safe space for learning including gender non-binary washrooms and an enforced <a href="/coc">code of conduct</a>. We also take great pride in attracting attendees from all around the world. Toronto is diverse and so should it's leading tech event!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
        <h3>High Quality Practical Content</h2>
          <p>Our event planning process starts with great quality content, we carefully select technologies, tools, and methods to cover in our event, that you can go right back to work and start integrating into your existing stack. Lay those topics out in the schedule so you get exposed to more than just your specialization and stack, then find amazing speakers to talk in those spots. This is a lot different than the traditional CFP process that picks from a list of submitted sessions, we seek out great content and great speakers to present it!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
        <h3>Networking</h2>
          <p>We know that not all of you are extroverts and that these large social settings can make it hard to feel included and strike up a conversation. We design our experience around breaking down barriers. Our event space is barrier free for ease of access to all, we offer you a space on your name tag to put your passion so someone else can make that first intro, and we've put games, lego, and other icebreakers around the venue so you can come together over a common task and feel less like you're being interrogated. Plus the mix of designers and developers at the event spurs some amazing conversations!</p>
