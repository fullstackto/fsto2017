        <h3>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</h2>
          <p>#fstoco is organized by a diverse group of individuals, and seeks to have a diverse line-up of speakers. We make sure that our event is a safe space for learning including gender non-binary washrooms and an enforced <a href="/coc">code of conduct</a>. We also take great pride in attracting attendees from all around the world. Toronto is diverse and so should it's leading tech event!</p>

        <h3>High Quality Practical Content</h2>
          <p>Our planning process starts with great quality content, we carefully select topics that you can go right back to work and start integrating into your existing stack. Those topics are laid out in the schedule so you get exposed to more than just your specialization and stack, then find amazing speakers to talk in those spots. This is a lot different than the traditional CFP process.</p>

        <h3>Networking</h2>
          <p>We design our netowrking around breaking down barriers. We offer you a space on your name tag to put your passion so someone else can make that first intro, we've put games, lego, and other icebreakers around the venue so you can come together over a common task to feel less interrogated and a mix of designers and developers at the event spurs amazing conversations!</p>
