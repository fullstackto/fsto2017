        <h2>The Venue - Historic Automotive Building at Exhibition Place - 105 Princes' Blvd.</h2>
        <p>We're excited to be moving into a fully green facility this year, with close access to transit, lots of parking, and amazing views of the lake and surrounding architecture! Here is some intersting history about Exhibition Place and the Automotive building.</p>
        <p>The small fort of Fort Toronto (also called Fort Rouillé) was built by French fur traders in 1750–1751 as a trading post on the site of today's grounds. The area was an important portage route for Native Americans, and the French wanted to capture their trade before they reached British posts to the south. It was burned by its garrison in 1759 after other French posts fell to the British on Lake Ontario.</p>
        <p>The government of Upper Canada inaugurated a provincial agricultural/industrial exhibition in 1846, to be held annually in different localities. For the 1858 exhibition, to be held in Toronto, a permanent "Palace of Industry" exhibition building, based on London's Crystal Palace, was built at King and Shaw Streets in what is now Liberty Village. The site held four more fairs until the 1870s, when the City of Toronto decided the exhibition had outgrown the site. The City signed a lease with the Government of Canada for a section of the western end of the reserve in April 1878. The Palace of Industry was moved to a site on the reserve near today's Horticulture Building, reconstructed and expanded. The City sold the King and Shaw site to the Massey Manufacturing Company.</p>
        <p>When the CNE became the world's largest annual fair in 1920, a 50-year plan was launched following the urban design and architectural precedents of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.[6] Chapman and Oxley prepared the 1920 plan, which emphasized Beaux-Arts architecture and City Beautiful urban design. The Empire Court was to be a monumental central space with a triumphal arch and gates and monumental exhibition buildings with courtyards.</p>
        <p>The Automotive Building was constructed in 1929, designed by local architect Douglas Kertland in the Art Deco style. The building was initially used to display the latest car models to the public. During World War II, this building was the home to Toronto's naval reserve, known as HMCS York. A commemorative plaque to this can be found on the north side of the building.</p>

			<h2>While in Toronto</h2>
			<h3>Money</h3>
			<p>Toronto’s currency is the Canadian dollar. For denominations under five dollars we use coins – some we’ve even given cute names: the loonie ($1), and toonie ($2).
			<p>Since 2013 our bills have been made of polymer and have a number of interesting design elements. U.S. dollars are accepted in many Toronto establishments, although you’ll receive change in Canadian funds and exchange rates will differ from merchant to merchant</p>
			<p>You’ll find cash machines/ATMs all over the city and in most banks, hotels and shopping centres. Credit cards are accepted at all major retailers. Currency exchange is available at kiosks in the city and at the airport</p>
			<h3>Tipping</h3>
			<p>If you’re happy with the service you receive, a 20% tip is standard on the pre-tax bill is a standard expression of appreciation when dining out in the city. Note that some restaurants automatically add this gratuity when serving large groups, so be sure to check your bill.</p>
			<p>Tips are also expected for services such as haircuts, shoe shines and taxi rides. 15-20% is standard in these situations as well.</p>
			<h3>Taxes</h3>
			<p>The Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) is a 13% tax that is applied to most purchases of taxable supplies of goods and services in the Province of Ontario. The HST consists of a 5% federal portion and an 8% retail sales tax portion.</p>
			<h3>Taxis and Uber</h3>
			<p>Taxis and UberX in Toronto share the same base fare but differ in service, per kilometer rates and time rates. Both are regulated and able to be used at your discretion.</p>
			<h3>Parking</h3>
			<p>Parking on most downtown streets is limited to specific times of day, and often requires you to purchase and display a ticket from one of the parking machines located along the street. Be sure to check and obey the signs posted along the street to make sure your vehicle doesn’t get ticketed or, worse, towed away.</p>
			<p>There are also a variety of public parking lots throughout the city. City-owned lots are indicated by the ‘Green P’ logo – a large ‘P’ in a green circle. Plan in advance using <a href="http://parking.greenp.com/find-parking/" target="_blank">Green P’s parking locator</a> to find the nearest lot.</p>
