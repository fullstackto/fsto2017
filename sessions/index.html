          <h4>Monitoring and Instrumentation Strategies Tips &amp; Best Practices</h4>
          <h5>by <a href="/speakers#jonah">Jonah Kowall</a></h5>
          <p>Monitoring is complicated, and in most organizations consists of far too many tools owned by too many teams.  Fixing monitoring issues requires people, process, and technology. Hear common issues seen in the real world including what should be monitored or collected from a technology and a business perspective.</p>
          <p>Investigate what instrumentation is most scalable and effective across languages, commonly used APIs, and possibilities for capturing data from common languages like Java, .NET, and PHP. Cover browser and mobile instrumentation techniques. Get tips on which APIs to use, what open source tools and frameworks can be leveraged, and how to coordinate and communicate requirements across your organization.</p>
          <p>Key takeaways:
            <ul>
              <li>What is instrumentation, and what to instrument, collect, and store</li>
              <li>How this can be accomplished on common software stacks</li>
              <li>How to work with application owners to collect business data</li>
              <li>How correlation works in custom open source or packaged monitoring tools</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>One Data Pipeline to Rule Them All</h4>
        <h5>by <a href="/speakers#sam">Sam Kitajima-Kimbrel</a></h5>
          <p>There are a myriad of data storage systems available for every use case imaginable, but letting application teams choose storage engines independently can lead to duplicated efforts and reinventing the wheel. This talk will explore how to build a reusable data pipeline based on Kafka to support multiple applications, datasets, and use cases including archival, warehousing and analytics, stream and batch processing, and low-latency "hot" storage.</p>
          <p>This talk is for application, infrastructure, or data developers and anyone interested in using event buses for data ingestion and processing/storage. A basic familiarity with different types of data storage systems and the concept of extracting data from one system and loading it into another (ETL) would help but is not required.</p>
          <p>Attendees should expect to leave with a basic familiarity of the concepts of event sourcing, data buses, tiered storage, and be able to reason better about their data systems and how they're connected.</p>

        <h4>Fantastic Types and Where To Use Them</h4>
        <h5>by <a href="/speakers#luke">Luke Westby</a></h5>
          <p>You can be a functional programmer! And if you're building JavaScript apps, there's a good chance you already are. FP in languages like Haskell is about finding common ground with principles in math that let us talk about how all our different and diverse code works using a universal (isomorphic?) vocabulary. And since JavaScript comes with so much flexibility we can do the same thing on the client if only we take some time to learn the patterns. Join me for this talk and I'll teach you what things like Functors and Monads are, when to use them, and what you get as a reward for doing so.</p>

        <h4>Building Stateful Microservices With Akka</h4>
        <h5>by <a href="/speakers#yaroslav">Yaroslav Tkachenko</a></h5>
          <p>It seems like all the dust about microservices has finally settled. We know how to design, develop and operate them. Although most of the microservices are stateless - they delegate things like persistence and consistency to a database or external storage. But sometimes you benefit when you keep the state inside the application.</p>
          <p>In this presentation I’m going to talk about why you want to build stateful microservices and design choices you make. I’ll use Akka framework and explain tools like Akka Clustering and Akka Persistence in depth and show a few practical examples.</p>

        <h4>Node.js server side render in the Age of APIs</h4>
        <h5>by <a href="/speakers#ruy">Ruy Adorno</a></h5>
          <p>With the increasing popularity of Universal JavaScript and microservices, more and more front-end developers are taking ownership of their server-side render using Node.js.</p>
          <p>In this talk we'll see how leveraging APIs in both server and client side is giving birth to new libraries and frameworks and what is the role of a front end developer in this post-full stack world.</p>

        <h4>Designing Everyday Privacy and Security</h4>
        <h5>by <a href="/speakers#matt">Matthew Davey</a></h5>
          <p>Two factor shouldn't be just for security experts and encryption shouldn't be presented as defensive. I will look at security from the position of a utility for everyone. Framing it as friendly, important and placing importance on your personal data. Security and Privacy are complex ideas important to everyone. Learn how to lower the bar to entry using language, layout and levity.</p>

        <h4>Get your fancy pants on with Elixir</h4>
        <h5>by <a href="/speakers#ole">Ole Michaelis</a></h5>
          <p>With Elixir you get all the power of Erlang and it’s hardened frameworks and libraries like OTP and cowboy with a Ruby-esque syntax. When WhatsApp was sold to Facebook, everyone was talking about Erlang. Everyone wanted to know how it was possible to build such a resilient and highly scalable system. With hot code swapping, the BEAM Machine allows zero downtime deployments and gives you highly available systems.</p>

        <h4>Organizing Applications In The React Ecosystem</h4>
        <h5>by <a href="/speakers#alex">Alex Wilmer</a></h5>
          <p>Since the release and rise of React, client side architecture has become increasingly modular and there have been dozens of popular, but not necessarily compatible, strategies for organizing applications. There exists a plethora of boilerplates and articles on the subject and it's far too early declare a winner.</p>

          <p>This talk will examine the top methodologies over the past two years and see how they have evolved. The examination will consist of applying these methods to minimum viable examples in a digestible form to illustrate and magnify the advantages and pitfalls at different levels of scale.</p>

          <p>In the end we will look at how the Ontario Institute of Cancer Research is organizing several open source applications to benefit from all the lessons learned along the way. </p>
