          <h4>Monitoring and Instrumentation Strategies Tips &amp; Best Practices</h4>
          <h5>by <a href="/speakers#jonah">Jonah Kowall</a></h5>
          <p>Monitoring is complicated, and in most organizations consists of far too many tools owned by too many teams.  Fixing monitoring issues requires people, process, and technology. Hear common issues seen in the real world including what should be monitored or collected from a technology and a business perspective.</p>
          <p>Investigate what instrumentation is most scalable and effective across languages, commonly used APIs, and possibilities for capturing data from common languages like Java, .NET, and PHP. Cover browser and mobile instrumentation techniques. Get tips on which APIs to use, what open source tools and frameworks can be leveraged, and how to coordinate and communicate requirements across your organization.</p>
          <p>Key takeaways:
            <ul>
              <li>What is instrumentation, and what to instrument, collect, and store</li>
              <li>How this can be accomplished on common software stacks</li>
              <li>How to work with application owners to collect business data</li>
              <li>How correlation works in custom open source or packaged monitoring tools</li>
            </ul>

        <h4>One Data Pipeline to Rule Them All</h4>
        <h5>by <a href="/speakers#sam">Sam Kitajima-Kimbrel</a></h5>
          <p>There are a myriad of data storage systems available for every use case imaginable, but letting application teams choose storage engines independently can lead to duplicated efforts and reinventing the wheel. This talk will explore how to build a reusable data pipeline based on Kafka to support multiple applications, datasets, and use cases including archival, warehousing and analytics, stream and batch processing, and low-latency "hot" storage.</p>
          <p>This talk is for application, infrastructure, or data developers and anyone interested in using event buses for data ingestion and processing/storage. A basic familiarity with different types of data storage systems and the concept of extracting data from one system and loading it into another (ETL) would help but is not required.</p>
          <p>Attendees should expect to leave with a basic familiarity of the concepts of event sourcing, data buses, tiered storage, and be able to reason better about their data systems and how they're connected.</p>
